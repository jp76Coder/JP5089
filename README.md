- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JP5089. 
I live in Australia have an electrical engineering/business background and have been using Delphi for about 30yrs. Since a few years ago I switched to developing small business database systems full time. Lately I have been venturing into C#. I am also interested in how I can apply my coding expereince in Crypto Trading and blockchain technology...that is a developing story.
