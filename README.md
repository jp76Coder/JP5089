- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m John. 
I have an electrical engineering/business background and have been using Delphi for many yrs. Initailly I developed this skill in design engineering and calculations. The last 10 years I have been developing database systems and switched to full time 4 years ago. Lately I have been venturing into C#. I am also interested in how I can apply my coding expereince in Crypto Trading and blockchain technology.
